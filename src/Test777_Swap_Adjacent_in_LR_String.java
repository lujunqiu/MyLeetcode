/**
 * Created by lujunqiu on 2018/2/25.
 * Description:
 * In a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters, like "RXXLRXRXL", a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of "XL" with "LX", or replacing one occurrence of "RX" with "XR".
 * Given the starting string start and the ending string end, return True if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.
 * Example:
 * Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * We can transform start to end following these steps:
 * RXXLRXRXL ->
 * XRXLRXRXL ->
 * XRLXRXRXL ->
 * XRLXXRRXL ->
 * XRLXXRRLX
